To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use
for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.

unsigned long long for the principal and the payment cause it shouldn't be negative, money start from 0. 

double for the rate, I wanted to use "float" at the first but I learned float usually does not have enough precision. double is more precision and faster.
