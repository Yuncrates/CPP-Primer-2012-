What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? 
Between an unsigned and a signed type? 
Between a float and a double?

they have all different sizes. short(16bits) < int < long < long long(64bits)
unsinged represent negative or positive numbers (including zero)
signed represent only greater or equal to zero
flaot represent in one word(32bits), double in two words(64bits)
